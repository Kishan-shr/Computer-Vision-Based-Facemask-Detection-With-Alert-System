Project Overview
This project utilizes computer vision techniques to detect whether individuals are wearing face masks or not. The system is designed to analyze images and videos, identifying faces and determining if a mask is present. This project has numerous applications, including monitoring mask compliance in public spaces, enhancing security and surveillance systems, and supporting healthcare professionals in identifying individuals who may be at risk.

Features
Mask detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning
Real-time video analysis and processing
Support for various image and video formats
Customizable threshold for mask detection accuracy
Alert system integration using email, SMS, or API notifications (optional)
